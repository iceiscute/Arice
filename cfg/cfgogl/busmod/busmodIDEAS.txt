tier 1

good idea;zonemod mapscommon same as numbersmod, same throwables and pills, kits work the same. same witch and tanksurvivors will spawn with two kits and two defibs.no such thing as multiple guns per pile, when you pick up a gun that gun disapears so you are gonna need to put four of each weapon in the saferoom. uzi and shotgun with same ammo as normal zonemod. one hs like numbersmod but also one realism ak that works the same as larrys. (one uzi, one shotgun, one hs and one ak) 12-15 second spawn timer, complete rng. double and triple infected of every si except for spiiter, make the double and triple, and quad chargers very rare.jockey and hunter damage is uncapped, you can get 50+ damage pounces if you are high enough. all talk can be voted on
i think thats everything


no ammo pile during map, only other guns but since they will disspear on pickup ppl will need to be more careful
